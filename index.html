							<span align="left">
								
						<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Born and raised in northern New Jersey, Zachary Hayworth made frequent calls to professional sports teams as a high school student seeking a summer job. After receiving no response, he attempted to buy and re-sell sports cards, but found consumer demand only existed for the most outdated cards. As a result, he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available by way of the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. After creating several online product listings for prehistoric fossil assortments, he purchased some samples and sold out almost immediately. Over time, Zachary found he could negotiate and secure steep price discounts on excess, subpar grade fossils in high volume through mineral trade shows and other channels. Over time, the operation eventually grew to become one of the world's leading wholesalers of fossilized commodities. </h4>								
						<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from over 10 years of ownership, Zachary launched Hayworth & Co., a consulting and advisory service to guide both individuals and businesses on leveraging their strengths and identifying new opportunities. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in the specialty commodities space including wholesale tea and jewelry. Most recently, he currently operates Hayworth Sports Group, a firm that advises professional athletes. </h4></span></header>								</section>

He also pursued further research focused on management and strategy at several universities, including Columbia University in New York City. </h4>
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Currently, Zachary is a master's candidate at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he pursues a specialized course sequence focused on advanced business strategy, sports law, and managerial issues in sports.
