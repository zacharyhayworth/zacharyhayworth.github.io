When no one would offer him employment, he attempted sell his own sports cards and related collectibles on the internet. He quickly failed, as he found many consumers were only in search of sports collectibles that were extremely old and rare. Soon after, Zachary came up with a concept to identify the oldest possible item on earth and sell it by utilizing the newest e-commerce technologies and internet platforms. As a result, he created a venture that sold prehistoric fossils, uploading the first product listings from his high school library during his junior year. Over time, the company eventually grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, making high volume shipments worldwide on a daily basis. Zachary's experience also includes representating the world's largest producer of prehistoric fossil jewelry. He has negotiated and secured contracts with dozens of businesses on their behalf, including some of the most well-known entertainment centers, luxury resorts, theme parks, museums, aquariums, and key tourist attractions.
