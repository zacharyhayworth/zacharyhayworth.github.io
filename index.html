							<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5em"><b>Experience</b></h2>
							<span align="left">
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">A native of northern New Jersey, Zachary wrote letters to professional sports teams seeking a summer job as a high school teenager. When no team responded, he attempted to sell sports collectibles on the internet, but this quickly failed. However, he realized online buyers were frequently in search of rare items. As such, Zachary came up with the idea to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available through the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. Building on this concept, he created a venture to distribute prehistoric fossils. In the years that followed, the business grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, serving thousands of customers across the world. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary formed his consulting and advisory service to help other individuals and businesses capitalize on new opportunities, leverage their strengths, and improve in their respective fields. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in the e-commerce and specialty commodities space. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">To this day, Zachary continues to maintain a lifelong passion for sports. He has attended hundreds of National Basketball Association games and can frequently be found at major sports and entertainment events across the United States. Currently, he serves as an advisor to several prominent athletes at the professional level and is frequently sought out to provide insight on topics such as athlete management and player development. Zachary is also long-time assistant to the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current executive, Thomas R. Coughlin.</h4>
