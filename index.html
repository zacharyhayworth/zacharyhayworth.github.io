							<span align="left">
								
<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">A native of northern New Jersey, Zachary Hayworth formed The Hayworth Group after a longtime career as an entrepreneur. As a high school student, Zachary was fired from his first job at a local retail store due to inefficiency. Unable to find another job, he used his remaining personal funds to buy sports cards in bulk and re-sell them over the internet, which did not turn a profit. However, upon recognizing that consumers frequently sought rare items on the newest e-commerce platforms of the mid-2000s, he tested the marketability of prehistoric fossils, the world's oldest item. When his test inventory sold out within just a few hours, he created product listings on dozens of websites and began to build his first business. By the time he finished high school, Zachary had started to negotiate and secure steep price discounts on subpar grade fossils in high volume, which enabled him to market to companies rather than individual consumers. In the years that followed, the business evolved to become a leading supplier of fossilized commodities for the tourism, luxury resort, amusement park, mail order, and souvenir industries. </h4>		
<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary launched The Hayworth Group to guide both individuals and organizations on leveraging strengths and identifying new opportunities. He continues to maintain ownership holdings in ventures operating within specialty commodities, e-commerce, and sports.</h4></span></header></section>

							<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5em"><b>Education & Research</b></h2>
							<span align="left">
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary Hayworth has studied and conducted research at five different universities. Among his academic credentials are his Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and entrepreneurship with honors from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, which he completed in fewer than three years. He later obtained a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in management from the University of Massachusetts, where he graduated with highest distinction. </h4>
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Additionally, Zachary holds a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. At Duke, his academic curriculum was cross-departmental, which included courses in advanced business, law, and engineering. His associated research focused heavily on legal issues in sports, athlete representation, and the impact of technology on the sports industry. Zachary's thesis advisor was Dr. Paul Haagen of Duke Law School. </h4>
