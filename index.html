						<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Born and raised in northern New Jersey, Zachary Hayworth operates Hayworth & Co. as his core business. As a teenager, he made frequent calls to professional teams in his area with the hope of landing an arena job during games. Unable to find employment, he attempted to buy and sell sports collectibles online. During the process, he realized consumers actively sought the most outdated items, so he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available through the newest internet and e-commerce platforms. After creating several product listings for prehistoric fossils, he received orders instantly. He subsequently began to secure steep price discounts on subpar grade fossils in high volume through trade shows, private companies, and other channels. In the years that followed, the operation eventually evolved to become one of the world's leading suppliers of fossilized commodities. </h4>								
						<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary launched Hayworth & Co., a consulting and advisory service to guide both individuals and businesses on leveraging their strengths and identifying new opportunities. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in e-commerce and speciality commodities. Zachary Hayworth continued to maintain his lifelong affinity for the sports industry and went on to form Hayworth Sports Group, a firm that advises professional athletes on a wide range of business and personal matters. </h4></span></header></section>
