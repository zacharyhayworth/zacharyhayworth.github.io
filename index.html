							<span align="left">
								
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">At age 16, Zachary Hayworth made countless calls to professional sports teams seeking an arena job on game nights. After receiving no interest, he attempted to buy collections of sports cards and re-sell them individually over the internet, but quickly lost money. When he recognized that online consumers were constantly seeking rare and outdated items, he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available by using the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. After purchasing a small quantity of prehistoric fossils, he uploaded several product listings from his local library and sold out of his inventory within an hour. Realizing he was able to secure steep price discounts on overstock of imperfect quality, he began acquiring lower-grade fossils in high volume through tradeshows, excavation organizations, and various other channels. In the years that followed, the business eventually evolved into a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, supplying dozens of businesses and thousands of customers around the world. </h4>										
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary launched Hayworth & Co., a consulting and advisory service to guide both individuals and businesses on leveraging their strengths, identifying new opportunities, and improving in their respective fields. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in the e-commerce and specialty commodities space. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Since founding his first business, Zachary continued to maintain his lifelong passion for sports. He recently launched an athlete advisory firm and is now a certified agent with the National Basketball Players Association. Over time, numerous professional athletes have sought him out for advice and consultation on a wide range of matters. Zachary has attended hundreds of National Basketball Association games and can frequently be found at major sports and entertainment functions across the United States. He has also served as a long-time assistant to the New Jersey-based Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current executive, Thomas Coughlin.</h4></span></header>
