							<span align="left">
								
<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">A native of NJ, Zachary Hayworth founded The Hayworth Group after a longtime career as an entrepreneur. As a high school student, Zachary was fired from his first job at a local retail store because of inefficiency. Unable to find employment elsewhere, he attempted to buy and sell sports cards over the internet with no success. However, upon recognizing that consumers frequently sought rare items, he tested the marketability the world's oldest item, prehistoric fossils, on the newest e-commerce platforms of the mid-2000s. When his test inventory sold out within several hours, he used his remaining personal funds to acquire more and create product listings across dozens of websites. By the time he completed high school, Zachary had started to negotiate and secure steep price discounts on subpar grade fossils in high volume, which enabled him to market to companies rather than individual consumers. In the years that followed, the business evolved to become a leading supplier of fossilized commodities for the tourism, luxury resort, amusement park, mail order, and souvenir industries. </h4>		
<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary founded The Hayworth Group to guide individuals and organizations on leveraging strengths and identifying new opportunities. He continues to maintain ownership holdings in ventures operating within specialty commodities, e-commerce, and sports.</h4></span></header></section>

								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary Hayworth has studied and conducted research at five different universities. Among his formal credentials are his Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and entrepreneurship with honors from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, which he completed in fewer than three years. He later obtained a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in management from the University of Massachusetts, where he graduated with highest distinction. </h4>
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Additionally, Zachary holds a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. At Duke, his academic curriculum was cross-departmental, which included coursework in law, advanced business strategy, and sports management. His associated research focused heavily on legal issues in sports, athlete representation, and the impact of technology on the sports industry. Dr. Paul Haagen of Duke Law School supervised his thesis. Zachary is currently the Co-Chair of Duke's New Jersey Board. </h4>
