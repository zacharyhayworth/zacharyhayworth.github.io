									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary Hayworth has extensive experience as a consultant, advisor, representative, business manager, and entrepreneur.  </p>
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">During his early days of high school, Zachary frequently applied for part-time jobs to be able to afford tickets to New Jersey Nets basketball games, but was never offered employment. He then attempted to follow his passion for sports and sell his own basketball cards on the internet, but quickly failed due to low demand. Recognizing that consumers often sought extremely rare and unique items, Zachary came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available by utilizing the newest e-commerce technologies and internet platforms. As a result, he launched a venture to distribute prehistoric fossils. After uploading the first product listings from his high school library, he secured his first online order for a small assortment within a few hours. Over time, the company grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, sourcing from several continents and serving thousands of customers across the world. </p> 
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following a majority sale of assets to another operation, Zachary then reached an agreement to represent the world's largest producer of prehistoric fossil jewelry. In this capacity, he negotiated and secured contracts with dozens of clients on the company's behalf, including some of the most well-known entertainment centers, luxury resorts, theme parks, museums, and other major tourist attractions. </p> 
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">After many years as an entrepreneur, Zachary launched his consulting and advisory service to help individuals and businesses recognize new opportunities and consistently improve in their respective fields. He also became a minority stakeholder in the independent export division of India-based Haileyburia Tea Estates Ltd., and serves as the division's representative for the North American market. Spread over 3,000 acres, the company employs over 1,000 people and produces nearly 4 million pounds (1.8 million kilograms) of black tea annually. Zachary is also a long-time assistant to the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current executive, Thomas R. Coughlin.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">In case you were wondering, Zachary ended up being able to afford season tickets to the New Jersey Nets and attended nearly every home game for three straight seasons before the team ultimately relocated from East Rutherford, New Jersey. He still follows his passion for sports continues to pursue opportunities in the field. </p>
