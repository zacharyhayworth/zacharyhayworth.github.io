<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Hayworth Application Services has been serving applicants since 2007. Founded by Zachary Hayworth, who is widely regarded as one of the country’s top admissions consultants, Hayworth Application Services has helped hundreds of international dental and medical applicants gain acceptance to highly competitive United States academic and training programs over the last 15 years. With an extensive network of contacts at major universities across the United States, we are constantly up to date about the content advanced standing and professional programs do and do not want to see in an application. In addition to impactful writing work and expert advisory, the consistent discussions we have with university personnel has resulted in our ability to position many applicants for acceptance. Hayworth Application Services serves as a private advisor for a very small number of applicants each year. We are meant only for applicants who want to maximize the impact their application has on admission committees. </h4>		
<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Each application component we prepare and advise on begins with a comprehensive review of a client's candidacy. After the initial assessment, we then plan, organize, and implement a proper strategic presentation of each component based on who the applicant is. We especially help applicants set themselves apart through integrating proper psychology and strategy in their writing, leading the admissions reviewer to envision the applicant as a current professional, rather than an aspiring professional. We devote superior time and attention to every application component to ensure each is deemed the most competitive in the applicant pool. </h4></span></header></section><section id="education" class="box special">
