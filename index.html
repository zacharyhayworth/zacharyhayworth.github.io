							<span align="left">
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em"><b>Zachary Hayworth has over a decade of experience as a trusted advisor, business manager, consultant, representative, and entrepreneur.</b> A native of northern New Jersey, Zachary made frequent calls to professional sports teams at The Meadowlands Sports Complex seeking an after-school job during his junior year of high school. When no team would offer him an opportunity, he attempted to sell his own sports cards on the internet, but quickly failed due to low demand. However, realizing buyers were often in search of cards that were unique and outdated, he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest items and make them readily available by utilizing the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. As a result, he launched a venture to distribute prehistoric fossils, uploading the first product listings from his high school's library. In the years that followed, the business eventually grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, serving thousands of customers across the world. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his time as an entrepreneur, Zachary formed his consulting and advisory service to help other individuals and businesses capitalize on new opportunities, leverage their strengths, and improve in their respective fields. He also became a minority owner of the independent export division of India-based Haileyburia Tea Estates Ltd. Spread over 3,000 acres, the company employs over 1,000 people and produces nearly 4 million pounds (1.8 million kilograms) of black tea each year.</h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">To this day, Zachary continues to maintain a passion for sports. He has attended hundreds of N.B.A. basketball games and can frequently be found attending major sports and entertainment events across the country. Zachary is also a long-time assistant to the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current executive, Thomas R. Coughlin. </h4>
