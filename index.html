							<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5em"><b>Experience</b></h2>
							<span align="left">
								
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">At age 16, Zachary Hayworth made countless phone calls to professional sports teams seeking an arena job on game nights. After not receiving any response, he used his life savings to buy bulk lots of sports cards and attempted to re-sell the valuable cards individually over the internet. While he did not turn a profit, he recognized online consumers were constantly seeking rare and outdated items. As a result, he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available by using the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. After purchasing a small quantity of prehistoric fossils, he created several product listings from the library of his high school, which sold out within an hour. Over time, Zach found that he was able to secure steep price discounts on imperfect quality fossils, but still maintain their marketability. He began re-investing all profits into acquiring overstock of lower-grade fossils in high volume from tradeshows, excavation organizations, and various other channels. In the years that followed, the operation eventually grew to become one of the world's leading wholesalers of fossilized commodities. Following his exit from ownership, Zachary launched Hayworth & Co., a consulting and advisory service to guide both individuals and businesses. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in the e-commerce and specialty commodities space.  </h4>										
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary continues to maintain his lifelong passion for sports. Most recently, he launched an athlete advisory firm and is now a certified agent with the National Basketball Players Association. Throughout his career, and stemming from his sports-focused research, professional athletes have sought him out for advice and consultation on a wide range of business and personal matters. Zachary has attended hundreds of games across the National Basketball Association and can frequently be found at major sports and entertainment functions across the United States. He also serves as a long-time assistant to the New Jersey-based Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current team executive, Thomas Coughlin.</h4></span></header>
