							<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5em"><b>Experience</b></h2>
							<span align="left">
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">A native of northern New Jersey, Zachary made frequent calls to nearby professional sports teams during his high school years with the hope of getting a job at a stadium. When no team would offer him employment, he attempted to sell sports collectibles, but quickly failed. However, realizing buyers were often in search of rare items, he came up with the concept to identify the world's oldest product and make it readily available by utilizing the newest internet technologies and e-commerce platforms. This led him to launch a venture to distribute prehistoric fossils. After uploading two e-commerce product listings from the library of his high school, he sold out of his inventory within a day. Over the years, the business eventually grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, serving thousands of customers across the world. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Following his exit from ownership, Zachary formed his consulting and advisory service to help other individuals and businesses capitalize on new opportunities, leverage their strengths, and improve in their respective fields. He also became a minority owner of several other ventures in the e-commerce and specialty commodities space. </h4> 
								<h4 style="line-height: 180%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary continues to maintain a passion for sports. He has attended hundreds of National Basketball Association games and can frequently be found attending major sporting and entertainment events across the United States. He currently serves as an advisor to several prominent athletes and is also a long-time assistant to the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by former National Football League coach and current executive, Thomas R. Coughlin. </h4>
