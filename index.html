									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary Hayworth has widespread experience as a consultant, advisor, representative, business manager, and entrepreneur. A native of New Jersey, he has often worked out of nearby New York City. However, he has traveled to locations throughout the United States to meet the specialized needs of his clients. </p>
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em"> During his early years of high school, Zachary frequently applied for part-time work at local shopping centers and sporting goods stores, but was never offered a job. In an effort to save enough money to purchase tickets to New Jersey Nets basketball games, he attempted to buy packs of sports cards and sell them individually online. However, this quickly proved unsuccessful, as he realized the only sports collectibles in high demand were rare and very old. Soon after, Zachary came up with the concept to identify the oldest item on earth and sell it online. As a result, he launched a venture that sold prehistoric fossils. Initially utilizing the newest e-commerce technologies and internet platforms, he offered small collections of fossils that were millions of years old. The business eventually grew to become a leading wholesaler of fossilized commodities, making high volume shipments on a daily basis to consumers across the world. After his years as an entrepreneur, Zachary was hired to represent the world's largest producer of prehistoric fossil jewelry. During his time managing the company's client relations, he negotiated and secured contracts with dozens of businesses, including some of the most well known entertainment centers, luxury resorts, theme parks, museums, aquariums, and key tourist attractions.

										

										
										
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">Zachary is also a minority owner of, and advisor to, BKB, Inc., the independent export division of India-based Haileyburia Tea Estates Ltd. He serves as the sole company representative in the North American market. Spread over 3,000 acres, the company employs over 1,000 people and produces nearly 4 million pounds (1.8 million kilograms) of black tea annually.</p>
									<p style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: .75em">As someone who always strives to help others in need, Zachary has served a long-time assistant to the New Jersey-based Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation, an organization overseen by the former National Football League coach and current team executive, Thomas R. Coughlin. </p>
